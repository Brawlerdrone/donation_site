    <h3>Life as a Volunteer at Wings of a Dove Centre</h3>

    <p>

        Wings of a Dove Centre is located off Kangundo Road, Opposite Ruai Health Clinic, Njiru Sub County, Nairobi.
        
        We are inviting all individuals who would like to volunteer their time and effort towards the rehabilitation of our children to get in touch on the contacts we have provided.
        
        We recommend to stay at least for 3 months. In the beginning it will take some time to get into everything. In addition maybe you do not want to stay the whole time only in Wings of a Dove and want to explore other areas.
